Wireless Security Camera with the Arduino Yun

In this project, we are going to build our own DIY version of such devices. The project is based on the Arduino Yun, to which we are going to connect a standard USB webcam and a PIR motion detector to create some cool applications.

The first application will be a modern version of standard tasks that you want for a security camera: taking pictures when some motion is detected. The project will store pictures taken by the USB camera on an SD card inserted into the Yun, but that's not all. Because we are in the age of the Internet of Things, we also want these pictures to be automatically uploaded on a secure location. And that's exactly what we are going to do by uploading the pictures to Dropbox at the same time.
